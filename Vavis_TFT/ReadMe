1. Install TFT_eSPI & LVGL Libraries
   * Ensure you have installed the TFT_eSPI and LVGL libraries in Arduino IDE.
2. Configure TFT_eSPI Library
   * Locate and Open the TFT_eSPI Library:
      -> In your Arduino IDE folder, navigate to libraries and find the TFT_eSPI library.
   * Edit Display Driver in User Setup:
      -> Open the User_Setup.h file in the TFT_eSPI folder and uncomment your display driver.
      -> Alternatively, you can open User_Setup_Select.h and uncomment the line corresponding to your display setup.
   * Adjust Driver Settings:
      -> Go to the User_Setups folder within the TFT_eSPI folder.
      -> Locate your driver’s setup file, for example, Setup70d_ILI9488_S3_Parallel.h.
      -> Modify the pins and other settings to match your device configuration (e.g., ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 with an ILI9488 display).

3. Configure LVGL Library
   * Enable Configuration in lv_conf.h:
      -> In the LVGL library folder, locate lv_conf_template.h.
      -> Rename it to lv_conf.h, then copy this file to the src folder.
   * Adjust LVGL Settings in lv_conf.h:
      -> Set required options by changing "0" to "1" for desired features, such as:
      -> LittleFS support: Set LV_USE_FS_ARDUINO_ESP_LITTLEFS from 0 to 1. Define the drive letter for accessibility.
      -> PNG and BMP decoding: Enable LV_USE_LODEPNG to use PNG images and LV_USE_BMP to use BMP files.
      -> TFT_eSPI Compatibility: If using TFT_eSPI for display, set LV_USE_TFT_ESPI from 0 to 1.
4. Additional Resources for LVGL:
   * Image Converter: Use the LVGL Image Converter to convert images for LVGL.
   * Font Converter: Use the LVGL Font Converter for creating custom fonts.
